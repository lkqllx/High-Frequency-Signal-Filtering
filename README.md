# Deustche Bank Capstone Project - L1 Filter for High Frequency Signal
This repository was created for creating a L1 filter to purify the high frequency trading signals.
Several modules were included in this repo for different usages. 

## File
* [simulation.py](https://github.com/lkqllx/High-Frequency-Signal-Filtering/blob/master/codes/simulation.py)
This module is created for simulating high frequency signal randomly to validate the algorithms robustness and 
avoid over-fitting.

    where one function and one class were included:
    
    -> *func* noise_signal: to add noise in original data
    
    -> *class* RandSignal: to create step or high frequency like signal
*
